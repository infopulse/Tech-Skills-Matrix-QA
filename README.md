We encourage you to use this matrix in your companies to alline skills and knowledge of QA engineers worldwide.

It is expected:
1. every QA Engineer who claims specific seniority level must have 7+ basic skills not less then this level
2. every next seniority level includes skills and knoledge of all previous levels
3. tech skills are generalized to be applicable to wide range of engineers
